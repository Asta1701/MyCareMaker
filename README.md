# MyCareMaker
This the MyCareMaker App project. It is written using an AngularJS and Ionic framework. 

In the project root directory running the 'install_plugins' file will install the necessary plugins for this app to work.

Documentation can be found in the docs file and can be observed by running the index.html file in your browser. New documentation can be added by following the ngDocs and using the tags available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-jsdoc and then created by running the 'create_docs' file.

Ensure that the 'install_plugins' and 'create_docs' files are executable.
